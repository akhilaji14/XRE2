# What Is a Namespace?
Namespaces are a mechanism for organizing code into logical groups, much like folders in an operating system. They serve to **encapsulate related type definitions** (such as classes, structs, interfaces, etc.) into distinct groups that work together. This grouping not only helps keep projects organized but also prevents naming conflicts between types with the same name.

> In XFactory, think of namespaces as the way you might organize your scripts for different factory areas. For example, you might use `XFactory.Logistics`, `XFactory.Production`, or `XFactory.Assembly` as namespaces to keep scripts organized by station functionality. This way, even if you define a `RobotController` in multiple areas, there will not be naming conflicts.

## Key Features
- **Organization and Readability:** Just as folders help organize files in your operating system, namespaces group related types and behaviors. In the XFactory, scripts for drone navigation in the logistics station could be under `XFactory.Logistics`, while robot path planning in the welding station could fall under `XFactory.Welding`. This structured approach keeps your code modular and readable.

- **Avoiding Naming Conflicts:** In a complex environment like XFactory, you may have classes like `Controller`, `Sensor`, or `Manager` in different stations. Namespaces allow these to coexist. For instance, `XFactory.Logistics.Sensor` and `XFactory.Welding.Sensor` can both exist in your project. If needed, you can refer to them explicitly using their full names, or use namespace aliases for convenience.

- **Code Reusability and Encapsulation:** Grouping related behaviors—such as conveyor logic, robotic welding paths, or interactive screen controls—into their own namespaces makes it easier to reuse and debug them. For instance, a scanning algorithm written for logistics could be reused in assembly by referencing the appropriate namespace.


## `UnityEngine` Namespaces
Namespaces in Unity serve as organizational units that group related classes, functions, and types, helping you structure your code in a modular and manageable way. They allow you to reference specific functionality, such as rendering, physics, or input, without conflicts between similarly named classes. The table below summarizes the most important namespaces used in Unity scripting along with brief definitions:

- **`UnityEngine`:** Core Unity engine classes including `MonoBehaviour`, `GameObject`, `Transform`, and other fundamental types.
- **`UnityEngine.SceneManagement`:** Offers classes and methods for loading, unloading, and managing scenes.
- **`UnityEngine.UI`:** Provides access to Unity’s UI elements, such as Buttons, Text, and other UI components.
- **`UnityEngine.EventSystems`:** Contains interfaces and classes for handling UI events and input (e.g., pointer events).
- **`UnityEngine.Audio`:** Provides classes for audio playback and control, including `AudioSource` and `AudioMixer`.
- **`UnityEngine.InputSystem`:** The modern, flexible input system that supports multiple devices and action mapping.
- **`UnityEngine.XR`:** Provides basic classes for XR device tracking and input for VR/AR projects. It includes `UnityEngine.XR.Interaction.Toolkit`, which offers advanced components and tools for handling interactions in XR applications using the XR Interaction Toolkit.

# `UnityEngine`

The `UnityEngine` namespace is the cornerstone of Unity development. It provides the essential classes and methods that power the Unity engine, enabling you to create, control, and manipulate game objects and behaviors. This namespace contains `MonoBehaviour`, `GameObject`, and `Component` methods.

## `MonoBehaviour` Methods

These methods form the backbone of scripting in Unity. They allow you to control the lifecycle of your scripts and react to events during gameplay. Examples of `MonoBehaviour` methods include:
- `Start()`: Called before the first frame update—ideal for initialization (e.g., robot parameters or sensor states).
- `Update()`: Called once per frame—used for frame-based logic (e.g., quadruped or robot arm positioning).
- `Awake()`: Called when the script instance is being loaded—often used for registering components.
- `FixedUpdate()`: Called on a fixed time interval—perfect for physics calculations (e.g., forklifts or drone movement.).
- `OnCollisionEnter()`: Called when this `Collider`/`Rigidbody` has begun touching another `Rigidbody`/`Collider`—useful for identifying when a box hits a rack or a robot encounters an obstacle.

> The `MonoBehaviour` was thoroughly discussed in [C4](https://github.gatech.edu/mmoghaddam3/XRE/wiki/C4.-MonoBehaviour).


## `GameObject` Methods

`GameObject` is the primary building block of a Unity scene. It represents objects in your game world and can have multiple components attached to it. From instantiating and destroying objects to adding components and sending messages, these methods form the backbone of game object management in Unity. These are generally classified into `GameObject` methods and `Component` methods.

## `GameObject` Methods

`GameObject` is the primary building block of a Unity scene. It represents objects in your game world and can have multiple components attached to it. These methods are essential for managing `GameObjects` in Unity.

- **`Instantiate()`**: Creates a new instance of a `GameObject` or prefab at runtime. For example, `Instantiate(enginePart, new Vector3(2, 0, 0), Quaternion.identity);` spawns a new engine part at the given position.

- **`Destroy()`**: Removes a `GameObject` or component from the scene, either immediately or after a specified delay. For example,  `Destroy(defectivePart, 2f);` deletes the object after 2 seconds.

- **`Find()`**: Searches the current scene for a `GameObject` by name and returns the first match found. For example, `GameObject hmi = GameObject.Find("HMI_Display");` locates a control panel named HMI_Display.

- **`AddComponent<T>()`**: Dynamically adds a component of type `T` to the `GameObject`. For example, `gameObject.AddComponent<Rigidbody>();` adds physics behavior to the object at runtime.

- **`SetActive()`**: Activates or deactivates a `GameObject`, controlling whether it is visible and interactive in the scene. For example, `uiPanel.SetActive(false);` hides a UI element.

- **`CompareTag()`**: Checks whether the `GameObject`’s tag matches a specified string for condition-based logic. For example, `if (gameObject.CompareTag("Tool"))` filters actions to tool-related objects.

**Example:** 
Let's use `GameObject` methods to simulate interaction with tools on the drawer next to the CNC machine in XFactory's manufacturing station. Pressing the "New Part" button on the phone spawns a randomly selected prefab (either a raw material or finished part), attaches physics, and updates the UI with its tag. Pressing "Pass" or "Fail" removes the spawned part. Pressing the on/off button on the digital caliper toggles its display on or off. Create an empty GameObject named `DrawerManager` under the drawer GameObject and attached the following `InspectionDrawer.cs` script to it.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using TMPro;

public class InspectionDrawer : MonoBehaviour
{
    public GameObject rawMaterialPrefab;  // Prefab for raw material
    public GameObject finishedPartPrefab; // Prefab for finished part
    public TextMeshProUGUI partTypeText;  // UI text to show part tag

    private GameObject currentPart;

    // Called when "New Part" button is pressed on the phone
    public void SpawnNewPart()
    {
        // Randomly pick a prefab to spawn
        GameObject prefabToSpawn = 
            Random.value > 0.5f ? rawMaterialPrefab : finishedPartPrefab;

        // Instantiate the part at a fixed position with random Y rotation
        currentPart = Instantiate(
            prefabToSpawn,
            new Vector3(-13.38f, 1.12f, -13.86f),
            Quaternion.Euler(0, Random.Range(0, 360), 0)
        );

        // Add Rigidbody for physics
        currentPart.AddComponent<Rigidbody>();

        // Use tag to update the part type text
        if (currentPart.CompareTag("Raw Material"))
        {
            partTypeText.text = 
                "This is a Raw Material";
        }
        else if (currentPart.CompareTag("Finished Part"))
        {
            partTypeText.text = 
                "This is a Finished Part";
        }
    }

    // Called when "Pass" or "Fail" button is pressed
    public void RemoveCurrentPart()
    {
        if (currentPart != null)
        {
            // Remove the part from the drawer
            Destroy(currentPart);
        }
    }

    // Called when caliper on/off button is pressed
    public void ToggleCaliperDisplay()
    {
        // Find the display under Caliper_Digital_Bottom
        GameObject display = GameObject.Find(
            "Caliper_Digital_Bottom/Display"
        );

        // Toggle its active state
        if (display != null)
        {
            display.SetActive(!display.activeSelf);
        }
    }
}
```

1. **Create and Attach the Script:**
  - In the `Hierarchy`, right-click and select `Create Empty`. Rename it to `DrawerManager`.
  - In the `Inspector`, click `Add Component` and attach the `InspectionDrawer.cs` script.

    ![01](/Figures/C5/01.jpg)

2. **Assign Prefabs to the Script:**
  - Select `DrawerManager` in the `Hierarchy`.
  - Drag and drop the `CNC Mill Stock` prefab from the `Project` window, `Assets > XFactory > Prefabs > Production Equipment > CNC Parts` into the `Raw Material Prefab` field. Make sure the prefab's `Tag` is set to `Raw Material`.
  - Drag and drop the `CNC Mill Part` prefab from the `Project` window, `Assets > XFactory > Prefabs > Production Equipment > CNC Parts`  into the `Finished Part Prefab` field. Make sure the prefab's `Tag` is set to `Finished Part`.

    ![02](/Figures/C5/02.jpg)

3. **Assign the UI Text for Part Type:**
  - Locate the `TextMeshProUGUI` text object under `Phone/Display/Part Type`.
  - Drag this object into the `Part Type Text` field of the `InspectionDrawer.cs` script on `DrawerManager`.

    ![03](/Figures/C5/03.jpg)

4. **Connect Phone Button Events:**
  - Select the `New Part` button in the `Hierarchy`.
  - In the `Button (Script)` component, click the `+` in the `On Click()` section.
  - Drag `DrawerManager` into the object field and select `InspectionDrawer -> SpawnNewPart()` from the dropdown.
  - Repeat this for `Pass` and `Fail` buttons, assigning them to `RemoveCurrentPart()`.

    ![04](/Figures/C5/04.jpg)

5. **Connect the Caliper On/Off Button:**
  - Select the `On/Off` button under the caliper.
  - In the `On Click()` section, add a new event.
  - Drag `DrawerManager` into the object field and assign it to `DrawerInteraction -> ToggleCaliperDisplay()`.

    ![05](/Figures/C5/05.jpg)

6. **Test the Scene:**
  - Enter `Play` mode.
  - Press `New Part` to spawn a random part in the drawer.
  - Press `Pass` or `Fail` to remove the part.
  - Press the `On/Off` button on the caliper to toggle the digital display.

    ![06](/Figures/C5/06.jpg)

> You may have noticed that the on/off button turns off the caliper's display but doesn't turn it back on. Can you explain the bug?


## `Component` Methods

Components add functionality to GameObjects and are a core part of Unity's component-based architecture. Whether you are retrieving a single component, finding one among children or parents, or invoking methods across multiple components, these methods enable a modular and flexible design approach. Key methods to work with components include:

- **`GetComponent<T>()`**: Retrieves a component of type `T` that is attached to the same GameObject. For example, `Rigidbody rb = currentPart.GetComponent<Rigidbody>();` accesses the physics component on the newly spawned part in the example above.

- **`GetComponentInChildren<T>()`**: Searches for a component of type `T` on the GameObject or any of its child objects. For example,  `TextMeshProUGUI displayText = phoneDisplay.GetComponentInChildren<TextMeshProUGUI>();` finds the part type text under the phone's display.

- **`GetComponents<T>()`**: Retrieves all components of type `T` attached to the GameObject, returning an array. For example, `AudioSource[] alerts = phone.GetComponents<AudioSource>();` collects all sound sources from the phone device for control or diagnostics.

- **`GetComponentInParent<T>()`**: Searches the GameObject’s parent hierarchy for a component of type `T`. For example, `DrawerInteraction manager = GetComponentInParent<DrawerInteraction>();` accesses the logic controller from a UI button nested deep in the phone’s hierarchy.

**Example:**
Let's verify key components attached to drawer-related objects in the XFactory scene, such as parts, the phone, and UI elements. The following script checks for a `Rigidbody`, reads text from the phone's display, counts `AudioSource` components, and locates the main drawer manager script.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using TMPro;

public class ComponentChecker : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        // Get Rigidbody on the current part
        Rigidbody rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
        if (rb != null)
        {
            Debug.Log("Rigidbody found on part.");
        }

        // Find the TextMeshPro component in the phone display
        TextMeshProUGUI displayText = GetComponentInChildren<TextMeshProUGUI>();
        if (displayText != null)
        {
            Debug.Log("Found text component: " + displayText.text);
        }

        // Get all audio sources on the phone
        AudioSource[] audioSources = GetComponents<AudioSource>();
        Debug.Log("Number of audio sources: " + audioSources.Length);

        // Find the InspectionDrawer script in the parent
        InspectionDrawer manager = GetComponentInParent<InspectionDrawer>();
        if (manager != null)
        {
            Debug.Log("Connected to InspectionDrawer script.");
        }
    }
}
```

1. **Attach the Script:**
  - Create or select a GameObject involved in the drawer interaction (e.g., `Phone`).
  - In the `Inspector`, click `Add Component` and attach the `ComponentChecker.cs` script.

2. **Run and Observe:**
  - Enter Play mode in Unity.
  - Watch the `Console` for log messages confirming which components were found and accessed correctly.

# `UnityEngine.Audio`

The `UnityEngine.Audio` namespace is designed to manage audio features within Unity. It provides classes and methods to **control playback, mixing, and overall audio management** in your projects.

## `Audio Source`

The `AudioSource` class is a component that plays back audio clips in your scene. It controls the audio playback through various methods, enabling you to **start, pause, and stop sounds**. This component is essential for integrating sound effects, music, and voice-overs into your game or simulation. Important `Audio Source` methods include:

- `Play()`: This method **initiates the playback of the assigned `AudioResource`**. When called, it starts playing the audio from the beginning (or resumes if the audio was previously paused) on the `AudioSource` component. Use `Play()` when you want to start sound effects or background music immediately, such as when a game begins or when an event occurs. 

- `Pause()`: This method **temporarily halts the playback of the assigned `AudioResource`**. However, it retains the current position in the audio clip so that playback can resume from the same point. Use `Pause()` when you want to temporarily interrupt the audio—for example, when pausing the game—so that it can be resumed later without restarting the clip. 

- `Stop()`: This method **completely halts** the audio playback and **resets the playback position** to the beginning of the `AudioResource`. This is useful when you want to end the sound entirely or prepare the `AudioSource` for a new clip. Use `Stop()` when you want to immediately cease audio playback and ensure that it restarts from the beginning the next time you call `Play()`. 

**Example:**
The script below controls the CNC machine using **ON** and **OFF** buttons on the `HMI` mounted to the control panel (`CNC_Control_Panel`). When the **ON** button is pressed, the `AudioSource` on the `CNC_Mill_Set` GameObject plays the machine sound, simulating the machine being turned on. Pressing **OFF** stops the machine (i.e., the sound). 

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class CNCControlPanel : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Assign the AudioSource from CNC_Mill_Set in Inspector
    public AudioSource cncAudio;

    // Called when "On" button is pressed
    public void TurnOnCNC()
    {
        if (cncAudio != null &&
            !cncAudio.isPlaying)
        {
            cncAudio.Play();
            Debug.Log("CNC machine started.");
        }
    }

    // Called when "Off" button is pressed
    public void TurnOffCNC()
    {
        if (cncAudio != null &&
            cncAudio.isPlaying)
        {
            cncAudio.Stop();
            Debug.Log("CNC machine stopped.");
        }
    }
}
```

1. **Attach the Script:**
  - Select the `CNC_Control_Panel` GameObject in the hierarchy.
  - Click `Add Component` and attach the `CNCControlPanel` script.

2. **Assign the `AudioSource`:**
  - In the Inspector for `CNC_Control_Panel`, locate the `cncAudio` field in the script.
  - Drag the `CNC_Mill_Set` GameObject (which contains the `AudioSource`) into this field.

    ![08](/Figures/C5/08.jpg)

3. **Wire Up the Buttons:**
   - In the `Hierarchy`, expand `CNC_Mill_Set > CNC_Body > CNC_Control_Panel > HMI` (Canvas).
   - Select the `ON` button.
   - In the Inspector, under the `Button (Script)` component, find the `OnClick()` event list.
   - Click the `+` button to add a new event.
   - Drag the `CNC_Control_Panel` into the object field.
   - From the dropdown, choose `CNCControlPanel → TurnOnCNC()`.
   - Repeat the same steps for the `OFF` button, but assign `TurnOffCNC()` instead.

    ![09](/Figures/C5/09.jpg)

4. **Test the Setup:**
  - Enter `Play` mode.
  - Click the **ON** button to hear the machine startup sound.
  - Click the **OFF** button to stop the sound.


## AudioResource

`AudioResource` (called `AudioClip` in older versions of Unity) stores imported audio data such as machine sounds, effects, or background music. These assets are used by `AudioSource` components to play audio in your scene.

**Key Points:**
- **Storage:** Holds waveform data (e.g., WAV, MP3, Ogg) used at runtime.
- **Usage:** Assigned to an `AudioSource` to control playback through scripting or UI interaction.
- **Configuration:** Looping, volume, and other playback settings are handled via the `AudioSource`.
  
> In the CNC machine control panel example above, an `AudioResource` is assigned to an `AudioSource` on the `CNC_Mill_Set`, and playback is controlled by ON/OFF buttons in the HMI.

# `UnityEngine.UI`

The `UnityEngine.UI` namespace provides a robust framework for building and managing user interfaces in Unity. It contains components that let you design interactive and visually engaging UIs for games and applications. With these tools, you can create text displays, buttons, sliders, images, toggles, and more. This namespace is essential for any project that requires user interaction, as it simplifies the process of connecting UI elements with your game logic. Key UI components include `Text`, `Button`, `Image`, and `Toggle`.

## `Text`

The `Text` component is used for **displaying and updating text** on the screen. It is a fundamental UI element for showing instructions, scores, messages, or any information that the user needs to read. Important properties include:
- `text`: Property to `get` or `set` the displayed string.
- `color`: Property to change the text color.
- `fontSize`: Property to adjust the size of the text.

## `Text`

The `Text` component is used for **displaying and updating text** on the screen. In modern Unity development, **TextMeshPro** is the standard for rendering crisp, flexible UI text. It is commonly used to present real-time data such as status messages, metrics, or sensor values.

Important properties include:
- `text`: Sets or gets the displayed string.
- `color`: Sets the text color (e.g., for emphasis or alerts).
- `fontSize`: Adjusts the size of the text.

**Example:** 
Using `Text` properties, let's display the real-time weight of a box on an industrial scale. If the weight exceeds 50 KG, the text turns red to signal an overload condition.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using TMPro;

public class ScaleWeightDisplay : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Assign Box_Large_01a in Inspector
    public Rigidbody box;

    // Assign the Display text under HMI Canvas
    public TextMeshProUGUI displayText;

    public float warningThreshold = 50f;

    void Update()
    {
        if (box != null &&
            displayText != null)
        {
            // Calculate weight using mass and gravity
            float weight = box.mass;

            displayText.text =
                weight.ToString("00.00") + " KG";

            // Change color if weight exceeds threshold
            if (weight > warningThreshold)
            {
                displayText.color = Color.red;
            }
            else
            {
                displayText.color = Color.green;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

1. **Attach the Script:**
  - Create or select a logic controller under `Industrial_Scale_01a` (e.g., an empty GameObject named `ScaleLogicController`) or use the GameObject itself.
  - Add the `ScaleWeightDisplay` script to that object.

2. **Assign References in `Inspector`:**
  - Drag the `Box_Large_01a` GameObject (with a `Rigidbody`) into the `box` field.
  - Drag the `TextMeshProUGUI` `Display Text` object (under the `HMI` Canvas of the scale) into the `displayText` field.
  - (Optional) Set the `warningThreshold` field in the Inspector to define the weight (in KG) that triggers a red warning color (default is 50 KG).

    ![10](/Figures/C5/10.jpg)

3. **Test the Setup:**
  - Enter `Play` mode.
  - In the `Inspector`, modify the `mass` value of the box's `Rigidbody`.
  - Observe the `Display` text updating in real time and changing color to red when the weight exceeds the threshold (e.g., 50 KG).

    ![11](/Figures/C5/11.jpg)

## `Button`

The `Button` component is used for handling user clicks. It allows you to assign functions to be called when the button is pressed. The most important event related to this component is `onClick` to which you can add **listeners** using `AddListener()`.

**Example:** 
Let's use Unity's `Button.onClick.AddListener()` to handle user input via the HMI panel on the CNC machine, so that the **ON** and **OFF** buttons on the `HMI` log messages when pressed. This mirrors the earlier example where these buttons were wired to play and stop the CNC machine’s sound via an `AudioSource` on the `CNC_Mill_Set`. Attach the following script to the `HMI` GameObject in the `Hierarchy`.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.UI;

public class CNCButtonController : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Assign in Inspector (HMI On button)
    public Button onButton;

    // Assign in Inspector (HMI Off button)
    public Button offButton;

    void Start()
    {
        // Register click events for both buttons
        onButton.onClick.AddListener(
            HandleCNCOn
        );

        offButton.onClick.AddListener(
            HandleCNCOff
        );
    }

    void HandleCNCOn()
    {
        Debug.Log("CNC ON button pressed.");
        // Add logic to start CNC here
    }

    void HandleCNCOff()
    {
        Debug.Log("CNC OFF button pressed.");
        // Add logic to stop CNC here
    }
}
```

    ![12](/Figures/C5/12.jpg)

> Clicking the **ON** or **OFF** button on the CNC machine's HMI will trigger a debug message in the Console confirming the button press.


## Image
The `Image` component is used for **displaying images (sprites)** in the UI. It can be used for icons, backgrounds, or any other visual element. Important image properties include:
- `sprite`: Property to `get` or `set` the current sprite.
- `color`: Property to modify the tint of the image.

**Example:**  
This example demonstrates how to create a simple slideshow of engine diagrams on the `Interactive Engine Diagram` UI element in the `Display GT` monitor at the assembly station. It uses the `Image.sprite` property to cycle through a list of three sprites and the `Image.color` property to ensure the image is fully visible. A UI button with a `>` icon is placed below the image, and each click updates the displayed diagram, mimicking an interactive digital manual or display panel.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.UI;

public class EngineDiagramSlideshow : MonoBehaviour
{
    // The single Image UI element
    public Image diagramImage;

    // Array of slides as sprites
    public Sprite[] diagramSprites;

    private int currentIndex = 0;

    void Start()
    {
        ShowSlide(currentIndex);
    }

    public void ShowNextSlide()
    {
        currentIndex = (currentIndex + 1) %
                       diagramSprites.Length;

        ShowSlide(currentIndex);
    }

    private void ShowSlide(int index)
    {
        if (diagramSprites.Length == 0 ||
            diagramImage == null)
        {
            return;
        }

        diagramImage.sprite = diagramSprites[index];

        // Ensure the image is fully visible
        // (in case it was tinted or transparent)
        diagramImage.color = Color.white;
    }
}
```

1. **Attach the Script:**
  - Add the `EngineDiagramSlideshow` script to the `Canvas` GameObject under `Display GT`.
  - Drag the `Interactive Engine Diagram` UI Image into the `diagramImage` field.
  - Add the three diagram slides (as `Sprite` assets) to the `diagramSprites` array in the `Inspector`.

    ![13](/Figures/C5/13.jpg)

2. **Set Up the Button:**
  - Place a UI Button (with a `>` icon) under the image. Name it `Slideshow` or something similar.
  - In the button’s `OnClick()` list, add the Canvas or GameObject with the script.
  - Choose `EngineDiagramSlideshow → ShowNextSlide()`.


    ![14](/Figures/C5/14.jpg)

3. **Preview the Result:**
  - Enter `Play` mode. 
  - Click the button to cycle through the slideshow sprites.

## Toggle

The `Toggle` component is a checkbox-like element that allows users to **enable or disable options**. It is useful for settings and options menus. Important properties include:
- `isOn`: Property indicating whether the toggle is on (`true`) or off (`false`).
- `onValueChanged`: An event that gets triggered when the toggle state changes.

**Example:** 
This example demonstrates how to use the `Toggle` component's `isOn` property and `onValueChanged` event to control the visibility of an instruction panel (`Instruction Scrollbar`) on the DisplayGT monitor in the assembly station. When the user interacts with the `Instructions Toggle`, the script shows or hides the scrollable panel and logs a message to the `Console` indicating the current state.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.UI;

public class InstructionToggleController : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Assign the "Instructions Toggle"
    public Toggle instructionsToggle;

    // Assign the "Instruction Scrollbar"
    public GameObject instructionPanel;

    void Start()
    {
        // Set initial visibility based on the toggle state
        instructionPanel.SetActive(
            instructionsToggle.isOn
        );

        // Add listener to handle toggle interaction
        instructionsToggle.onValueChanged
            .AddListener(delegate
        {
            instructionPanel.SetActive(
                instructionsToggle.isOn
            );

            // Log a message indicating current state
            if (instructionsToggle.isOn)
            {
                Debug.Log("Instructions panel shown.");
            }
            else
            {
                Debug.Log("Instructions panel hidden.");
            }
        });
    }
}
```

1. **Attach the Script:**
  - Add the `InstructionToggleController` script to the `Canvas` GameObject under `DisplayGT` (or any suitable UI controller object in that hierarchy).
  - Drag the `Instructions Toggle` (the UI Toggle element) into the `instructionsToggle` field.
  - Drag the `Instruction Scrollbar` (the scrollable text panel GameObject) into the `instructionPanel` field.

2. **Configure Initial Visibility:**
  - Ensure the `Instruction Scrollbar` is active or inactive in the scene based on your preferred default state.
  - The script will automatically sync its visibility with the toggle’s `isOn` state at runtime.

3. **Test the Toggle:**
  - Enter `Play` mode in Unity.
  - Click the toggle to show or hide the instruction panel.
  - Open the `Console` to see log messages confirming whether the instructions are shown or hidden.

# `UnityEngine.SceneManagement`

The `UnityEngine.SceneManagement` namespace is essential for managing scenes in Unity. It provides developers with the tools needed to **load, unload, and transition between different scenes**. Scenes represent different levels, game states, or environments. Using these methods allows you to build fluid game experiences, such as level transitions, dynamic loading of game content, and asynchronous scene management for smoother performance. Key `SceneManager` methods include: 

- **`LoadScene()`:** The `SceneManager.LoadScene()` method loads a new scene by name or index. This is commonly used to switch between levels or restart a game.
 
- **`UnloadSceneAsync()`:** The `SceneManager.UnloadSceneAsync()` method unloads a scene asynchronously, freeing up resources. This method is useful when you need to remove a scene without causing a frame rate drop or interruption.
 
- **`GetActiveScene()`:** The `SceneManager.GetActiveScene()` method returns the currently active scene. This is useful for obtaining scene-specific information, such as the scene name or build index.

- **`sceneLoaded` (event):** The `SceneManager.sceneLoaded` event is triggered once a scene has finished loading. It allows you to perform additional actions immediately after a scene transition, such as initializing game objects or setting up UI elements.


**Example:**
Let's trigger both loading and unloading the XFactory yard scene (exterior) by opening and closing a door in the XFactory using keyboard input. Pressing the `O` key gradually rotates the door open on the `Y`-axis from `0°` to `-120°`. As soon as the door’s `Y` rotation dips below `0°`, the `Factory Yard Scene` is loaded additively using `SceneManager.LoadScene()`. Pressing the `C` key closes the door by rotating it back to `0°`, and once fully closed, the scene is unloaded using `SceneManager.UnloadSceneAsync()`. This simulates spatially-aware scene streaming, improving performance and immersion in large environments.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;

public class FactoryDoorLoader : MonoBehaviour
{
    public string exteriorSceneName = 
        "Factory Yard Scene";

    public float rotationSpeed = 60f;

    private Quaternion openRotation;
    private Quaternion closedRotation;

    private bool opening = false;
    private bool closing = false;
    private bool sceneLoaded = false;

    void Start()
    {
        closedRotation = Quaternion.Euler(
            0f, 0f, 0f
        );

        openRotation = Quaternion.Euler(
            0f, -120f, 0f
        );
    }

    void Update()
    {
        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.O))
            opening = true;

        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.C))
            closing = true;

        if (opening)
        {
            transform.rotation = Quaternion.RotateTowards(
                transform.rotation,
                openRotation,
                rotationSpeed * Time.deltaTime
            );

            float yAngle = NormalizeAngle(
                transform.eulerAngles.y
            );

            if (!sceneLoaded && yAngle < 0f)
            {
                SceneManager.LoadScene(
                    exteriorSceneName,
                    LoadSceneMode.Additive
                );

                sceneLoaded = true;
                Debug.Log("Factory Yard Scene loaded.");
            }

            if (Quaternion.Angle(
                    transform.rotation,
                    openRotation
                ) < 0.1f)
            {
                opening = false;
            }
        }

        if (closing)
        {
            transform.rotation = Quaternion.RotateTowards(
                transform.rotation,
                closedRotation,
                rotationSpeed * Time.deltaTime
            );

            if (Quaternion.Angle(
                    transform.rotation,
                    closedRotation
                ) < 0.1f)
            {
                closing = false;

                // Unload the scene when the door fully closes
                if (sceneLoaded &&
                    SceneManager.GetSceneByName(
                        exteriorSceneName
                    ).isLoaded)
                {
                    SceneManager.UnloadSceneAsync(
                        exteriorSceneName
                    );

                    sceneLoaded = false;
                    Debug.Log("Factory Yard Scene unloaded.");
                }
            }
        }
    }

    float NormalizeAngle(float angle)
    {
        return (angle > 180f) ?
            angle - 360f :
            angle;
    }
}
```

1. **Attach the Script:**
  - Add the `FactoryDoorLoader` script to the door GameObject (e.g., `Door_01`).
  - Ensure the door GameObject has a `Collider` component (it does not need to be a trigger).

    ![17](/Figures/C5/17.jpg)

2. **Configure Scene Reference:**
  - In the script’s `exteriorSceneName` field, type the exact name of your scene asset (e.g., `Factory Yard Scene`).
  - Go to `File > Build Profiles` and open your active build profile.
  - In the profile’s `Scene List`, click `Add Open Scene` after additively opening the `Factory Yard Scene` in the Editor (right-click > `Open Scene Additive`).

    ![18](/Figures/C5/18.jpg)

3. **Testing in Play Mode:**
  - Enter `Play` mode in the Unity Editor.
  - Press `O` to open the door. Once its `Y` rotation passes below `0°`, the `Factory Yard Scene` loads additively.
  - Press `C` to close the door. Once it fully returns to `0°`, the `Factory Yard Scene` is unloaded automatically.

# `UnityEngine.XR`

Finally, let's review the foundational namespaces in Unity that power XR development. The `UnityEngine.XR` namespace is Unity’s **base-level XR API**, giving you direct access to **low-level XR device data**, including tracking information, device presence, and positional data for VR/AR hardware. Key components include:

- **`XRDevice`**: Provides basic information about the connected XR hardware (e.g., whether a headset is present). It is useful for checking hardware availability at runtime.
- **`InputTracking`**: Allows access to the position and rotation of XR input sources like the headset or controllers. You can track specific nodes (e.g., head, hands) in real time.
- **`XRNode`**: An enumeration that defines which part of the XR device you're tracking (`Head`, `LeftHand`, `RightHand`, etc.).

> The `UnityEngine.XR` namespace establishes the **core understanding of XR input** and device tracking. Even if you later use higher-level systems like XR Interaction Toolkit, understanding how Unity tracks hardware through this namespace helps you troubleshoot, extend, or fine-tune your XR experiences. It is especially useful in cases where raw tracking data is needed—like monitoring head position in safety-critical areas.


## `UnityEngine.XR.Management`

This namespace extends `UnityEngine.XR` by managing the **lifecycle and configuration** of XR subsystems through the **XR Plugin Management** system. It allows Unity to interface with different XR platforms such as **OpenXR**, **Oculus**, or **Windows MR** through a standardized plugin framework. Key components include:

- **`XRGeneralSettings`**: Stores global XR configuration and determines how and when XR initializes during app startup.
- **`XRManagerSettings`**: Controls startup/shutdown of XR subsystems (e.g., input, rendering, tracking).
- **`XRLoader`**: Each XR plugin provides a loader that handles initializing that specific platform's features.

>  Without this namespace, Unity wouldn’t know which XR runtime to launch or how to configure it. You will work with it when setting up your project to use **OpenXR** for both VR and AR platforms. It is essential for building **cross-platform** apps that automatically load the right XR environment at runtime.


## `UnityEngine.XR.Interaction.Toolkit`

The XR Interaction Toolkit builds on `UnityEngine.XR` and `XR.Management` to offer a **high-level, component-based framework** for common VR interactions. It removes the need to code most input logic from scratch and offers prefab-ready systems for locomotion, grabbing, UI, and physics-based interaction. Key components include:

- **`XRController`**: Maps input from XR devices such as hand controllers.
- **`XRGrabInteractable`**: Enables objects to be picked up, moved, or manipulated using XR input.
- **`XRRayInteractor`**: Provides ray-based interaction, like a laser pointer, for UI or distant objects.
- **`XRInteractorLineVisual`**: Visually represents the ray or interaction line in VR scenes.

> This namespace will be your **primary toolset during the VR development module**. It drastically reduces development time by abstracting away controller input logic and interaction mechanics, allowing you to focus on designing interactive scenes. It’s also extensible, so you can build custom behaviors atop a robust base.


## `UnityEngine.XR.ARFoundation`

AR Foundation extends Unity’s XR support to AR, abstracting the differences between **ARKit** (iOS), **ARCore** (Android), and platforms like **Magic Leap**. It builds on `UnityEngine.XR` by introducing AR-specific features like plane detection, light estimation, and anchors. Key components include:

- **`ARSession`**: Manages the AR lifecycle, including reset and pause/resume behavior.
- **`ARPlaneManager`**: Detects and tracks real-world flat surfaces using device sensors and camera input.
- **`ARCameraManager`**: Accesses and controls camera features such as light estimation, focus modes, and exposure.

> This namespace will power your **AR development module**, enabling real-world spatial understanding and overlaying virtual content. It allows you to build cross-device AR experiences without writing platform-specific code, making your AR apps portable and future-ready.


## `UnityEngine.XR.OpenXR`

This namespace represents Unity’s implementation of the **OpenXR standard**, which aims to unify XR development across devices and vendors. It acts as the foundation behind **XR Plugin Management** when the **OpenXR loader** is selected. Key points to consider:

- OpenXR is a **vendor-neutral standard** supported by Meta, HTC, Microsoft, Magic Leap, and others.
- Most functionality is configured through the Unity Editor and **XR Plugin Management**, not through scripting in this namespace.
- It supports **device-specific extensions** for advanced features (e.g., hand tracking, eye tracking, passthrough) in a modular, future-proof way.

>  OpenXR allows you to write **one XR application** and deploy it across **multiple platforms**. It’s the most scalable way to support both **Meta Quest (VR)** and **Magic Leap 2 or mobile (AR)** with the same codebase. Understanding how OpenXR fits into Unity’s XR stack ensures you are ready to build **long-lasting, portable, and maintainable XR apps**.


## Summary

By organizing XR development in Unity through modular namespaces, Unity allows developers to start simple and grow into powerful, platform-agnostic solutions. Here’s how the pieces fit together:

| Namespace                     | Role                                             | You’ll Use It For...                      |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `UnityEngine.XR`             | Low-level XR tracking                            | Understanding headset/controller tracking |
| `UnityEngine.XR.Management`  | Plugin setup and runtime control                 | Configuring XR platform and loaders       |
| `UnityEngine.XR.Interaction.Toolkit` | High-level VR interaction system       | Grabbing, teleporting, interacting in VR  |
| `UnityEngine.XR.ARFoundation`| Cross-platform AR functionality                  | Plane detection, anchors, camera access   |
| `UnityEngine.XR.OpenXR`      | Open, vendor-agnostic runtime layer              | Supporting Meta Quest, Magic Leap, etc.   |


> As you move into the final VR and AR modules of this course, these namespaces will become your core tools. Mastering their purpose and how they interconnect will allow you to build immersive, interactive XR applications that scale across devices and platforms.
