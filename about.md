# Course Requirements & Grading

## Grading Components

- **Participation (5%):** Participation will be recorded via Canvas for each class session. Students are expected to communicate any absences to the instructor in advance and provide a legitimate reason to be excused. 
- **Quizzes (10%):** Quizzes will be taken in class on an ad-hoc basis through Canvas. These quizzes are only available to students who attend class. Quiz topics will align with recent course material and count towards both quiz grades and participation.
- **Assignments (15%):** Weekly assignments will be given on programming, Unity development, and short essays. Students will occasionally deploy and test their apps on XR simulators and mobile devices, as outlined in the Course Schedule. Assignments must be submitted via Canvas and/or the course’s GitHub within a one-week deadline. 
- **Project (30%):** Students will work in groups on a semester-long project to identify and solve a real-world engineering problem using custom AR/VR apps. Milestones and deliverables are specified in the Course Schedule.
- **Exam (40%):** A comprehensive written final exam will be administered during finals week. The exam assesses students’ understanding of course concepts, programming principles, and practical applications discussed throughout the semester.

> While the core curriculum and project structure remain consistent across both levels, **graduate students** will be expected to meet additional requirements that emphasize research integration and advanced technical competency. For the semester-long project, graduate students must conduct a literature review of at least five peer-reviewed sources, build their application to advance the identified research topics, fully develop the app, and prepare a formal human subjects study design to validate their system. Weekly assignments will include added research-oriented tasks focused on identifying open research questions in XR for engineering and proposing strategies to address them, supported by relevant literature. On the final exam, graduate students will complete additional advanced questions covering C# programming and XR development in Unity.

## Grading Scale
**A:** 90–100%  
**B:** 80–89%  
**C:** 70–79%  
**D:** 60–69%  
**F:** 0–59%

# Policies, Expectations, & Guidelines

## Academic Integrity
Georgia Tech aims to cultivate a community based on trust, academic integrity, and honor. Students are expected to act according to the highest ethical standards. Review Georgia Tech’s [Honor Code](https://catalog.gatech.edu/policies/honor-code) and [Code of Conduct](https://catalog.gatech.edu/rules/18). Any student suspected of cheating or plagiarizing on a quiz, exam, or assignment will be reported to the Office of Student Integrity, who will investigate the incident and identify the appropriate penalty for violations.

## Accommodations for Students with Disabilities
If you are a student with learning needs that require special accommodation, contact the [Office of Disability Services](http://disabilityservices.gatech.edu), 404-894-2563, as soon as possible to make an appointment to discuss your special needs and to obtain an accommodations letter.  Please also e-mail me as soon as possible to set up a time to discuss your learning needs.
