# Spatial Awareness in VR

**Spatial awareness** in VR refers to the user’s ability to perceive and understand the positions, orientations, and relationships of objects—and of themselves—within a three-dimensional virtual environment. This awareness is driven by multisensory input, including visual, auditory, and haptic cues, and is enhanced by technologies such as head tracking, hand/controller tracking, spatialized sound, and real-time feedback. To support this immersive perception, VR environments rely on a set of **coordinate systems**—including world, local, and camera-relative frames of reference—that define how objects are positioned, moved, and interacted with. Understanding these coordinate systems is fundamental to designing VR experiences that feel spatially coherent, responsive, and believable.


## Coordinate Systems in VR

In VR development, coordinate systems provide the framework for **positioning**, **orienting**, and **scaling** every element in your virtual world. A deep understanding of coordinate systems in VR is critical for creating immersive and technically robust experiences. By mastering the interplay between world, local, and view coordinate systems—and understanding how Unity’s left-handed system operates—you can ensure that every object in your virtual world is placed accurately and behaves consistently. Coordinate systems are essential for:

- **Creating Consistent Environments:** Ensuring that virtual objects maintain their intended spatial relationships as the user moves.
- **Achieving Immersion:** Accurate positioning and orientation of objects help the user feel grounded within a believable, interactive space.
- **Technical Precision:** Proper management of coordinate systems minimizes errors like drift or scaling mismatches that can break immersion.


## Cartesian Coordinate Systems
VR applications rely on Cartesian coordinate systems defined by three perpendicular axes:

- **`X`-axis:** Represents horizontal movement, with the positive direction typically pointing to the right.
- **`Y`-axis:** Represents vertical movement, with the positive direction pointing upwards.
- **`Z`-axis:** Represents depth. The direction of the positive Z axis depends on the system's handedness.

> When placing racks in the logistics station using coordinates like `(5, 0, 10)`, pay attention that `X` moves the object rightward in the warehouse, and `Z` moves it deeper into the storage zone.

## Right-handed vs. Left-Handed
- **Right-handed Coordinate System:** Uses the right hand to determine axis directions. With your right hand, point your index finger along the positive `X` axis and your middle finger along the positive `Y` axis; your thumb then points in the positive `Z` direction. In this system, objects closer to the viewer have lower `Z` values because the positive `Z` axis points toward you.

- **Left-handed Coordinate System:** Uses the left hand for the axis orientation. Here, the positive `Z` axis points away from the viewer. **Unity uses a left-handed system for its 3D world.** This means when you specify a position like `(X, Y, Z)`, the `Z` value increases as objects move away from the camera. Knowing your system’s handedness helps in importing assets, adjusting lighting, and ensuring proper camera behavior.

> In XFactory, while placing robots in the welding station, ensure `Z+` moves them deeper into the scene. Accidentally applying a right-handed assumption could misplace components behind walls or outside the factory bounds.


## World Coordinate System

The world coordinate system is the **global reference frame** for the entire scene. The world origin `(0, 0, 0)` is typically set near the player’s starting point or a defined central location in the virtual factory. Every object's position is ultimately measured from this origin, ensuring a consistent spatial layout across the environment.

![01](/Figures/D2/01.jpg)


> In the logistics station, select a drone or scanner. Toggle between `Global` and `Local` handle modes in the Unity toolbar, then move the object using the `Move` tool (`W`). In `Global` mode, the arrows follow the fixed world axes (`X`: red, `Y`: green, `Z`: blue), while in `Local` mode, they align to the object’s current rotation. This clearly shows how world and local directions differ.


## Local Coordinate System

Every GameObject in Unity also has a **local coordinate system**—its own frame of reference. This becomes especially important when objects are part of a hierarchy. Local coordinates simplify control over joints, attachments, and child objects that move with their parent.

![02](/Figures/D2/02.jpg)


> In the exhibit station, select one of the leg joints on the quadruped robot (`Spot`). Use the `Rotate` tool (`E`) and toggle between `Local` and `Global` modes. When you rotate the joint in `Local` mode, the rotation follows the natural direction of the joint, consistent with the leg’s intended movement. In `Global` mode, the gizmo remains aligned with the world axes, making the rotation feel off or unnatural for articulated motion.

## Camera Coordinate System

The camera (or headset) coordinate system is dynamic—it updates in real time with the user's head position and orientation. In XR, the camera becomes the user's point of view, serving as the basis for rendering the scene and positioning UI or interactive elements. Key spatial behaviors and scenarios include:

- **World-Locked Content:** Objects are fixed in the environment and do **not** follow the user (i.e., the camera). Ideal for props, machines, landmarks, or spatial UI that needs to stay consistent as the user moves around. For example, the CNC machines in the manufacturing station remain anchored regardless of user movement.

- **Head-Locked (View-Fixed) Content:** Objects move with the user’s head, maintaining a fixed offset in view space. Common for HUDs, notifications, or tooltips. Use sparingly to avoid motion sickness or visual overload.

- **Seated Experiences:** The user is expected to stay seated. The world origin is usually aligned with the user’s **initial head position**, making camera-relative offsets predictable in limited physical space. This is suitable for **simulations** or **control panels** where physical movement is minimal.

- **Standing Experiences:** The user stands and may walk or move within a physical play area. The world origin is aligned with the **floor plane**, and content should be positioned with physical scale and posture in mind. This is useful for interactive demos or exploring full-scale scenes like XFactory’s exhibit zone.

- **Hybrid Experiences:** Some setups blend seated and standing interactions—for example, a user may stand to explore content but sit to operate a virtual machine. In XFactory’s exhibit station, users may stand to explore AR/VR displays but sit for testing simulations, requiring flexible origin handling.


> Drifts may happen as a result of gradual inaccuracies in the system’s understanding of position over time. Techniques such as **periodic re-centering of the world origin** help minimize drift. Regular calibration ensures that long-duration VR sessions maintain positional accuracy and prevent the feeling of disorientation.


## Proxemics in VR

While coordinate systems define spatial logic, **proxemics** adds the layer of human comfort and social behavior. Proxemics is the study of personal space and how individuals perceive the proximity of others. In VR, understanding proxemics is critical for crafting social interactions that feel natural and respectful. The **zones of personal space** are:

- **Intimate Space (0–0.5m):** Reserved for close interactions involving trust or haptic feedback. Avoid intrusions by avatars or tools unless explicitly triggered.
- **Personal Space (0.5–1.5m):** Ideal for one-on-one interactions, routine tasks, or UI panels. This zone is central for comfort and control.
- **Social Space (1.5–4m):** Used in group discussions or multiplayer interactions. Design layouts that support face-to-face communication while maintaining space.
- **Public Space (4m+):** Suitable for large group presentations or broadcast-style interactions where users are present but not directly engaged.

> Understanding these zones ensures that your spatial design isn’t just technically accurate—but also socially intuitive and comfortable.

## Practical Considerations

Integrating spatial awareness and proxemics into VR development improves immersion, comfort, and usability.

- **Immersion and Presence:** Design environments that mirror real-world behavior. In XFactory’s Logistics Station, drones scanning boxes should leave appropriate space between themselves and users to avoid perceived collisions.

- **User Interaction and Testing:** Test interactions at different ranges and in various postures (standing, seated). Observe how users respond to proximity, reach, and UI placement.

- **Safety and Accessibility:** Prevent unwanted physical or emotional discomfort with well-defined boundaries. Use invisible walls, visual grids, or fading indicators to communicate limits. In XFactory, these are essential around moving equipment like CNC machines or robotic arms.

# Locomotion in VR

Locomotion is the method by which a user moves through and interacts with a virtual environment. In VR, effective locomotion is critical to creating an immersive, natural, and comfortable experience. Unity’s `XR Interaction Toolkit` provides a range of locomotion primitives—including **teleportation**, **snap turning**, **continuous turning**, and **continuous movement**—that can be tailored to suit different applications.

> In XFactory, users can explore the factory floor to observe different stations. **Continuous movement** lets them walk beside a moving forklift, while **teleportation** allows them to quickly reposition near a drone landing pad or machinery entrance. **Snap turning** allows the user to interact with screens or robots placed in a circular formation without physical turning.

## Principles of VR Locomotion

- **User Comfort and Safety:** Design locomotion to minimize motion sickness and disorientation. Use techniques like snap turning and teleportation for rapid repositioning while considering ergonomic factors for extended VR sessions. Ensure that only one locomotion method is active at a time via a centralized system to prevent conflicting commands.

- **Centralized Input Handling and Interaction Safety:** Favor action-based input over device-based input to simplify control mapping across diverse VR hardware. A centralized locomotion system not only prevents simultaneous actions but also provides a consistent, predictable user experience by handling input conflicts effectively.

- **Coordinate Space Management and Transformations:** Precisely manage conversions between device, local, and world coordinate spaces. Accurate transformation is essential for maintaining spatial consistency, immersion, and ensuring that physical movements are correctly mirrored in the virtual environment.

- **Modularity, Scalability, and Flexibility in Movement:** Build locomotion systems with modularity in mind by using simple placeholder assets that can be upgraded as needed. This approach supports scalability and allows developers to tailor the locomotion behavior—whether through rapid teleportation or immersive continuous movement—to suit the specific needs of different VR applications.


## `XR Rig` and Teleportation

The `XR Rig` is a `MonoBehaviour` that defines the user’s presence and interaction point in the virtual environment. It encapsulates the tracking origin, camera, and input controllers, and is the primary target manipulated by **locomotion systems** such as teleportation or continuous movement. In the context of teleportation, the `XR Rig` is crucial because teleportation involves **instantaneously repositioning the user within the virtual world**. This repositioning is applied to the **Rig’s root GameObject**, ensuring that all child objects—especially the head (camera) and hands (controllers)—move together coherently. Our imported `XR Rig` has the following structure

```
XR Rig (Root)
└── Camera Offset
    ├── Main Camera
    ├── LeftHand Controller
    └── RightHand Controller
```

- **`XR Rig` (Root):** This is the locomotion target. When teleportation occurs, the `Teleportation Provider` applies the position and rotation changes directly to this GameObject.
- **`Camera Offset`:** This intermediary object allows vertical alignment of the headset (camera) relative to the play area. This is useful for accounting for standing, seated, or room-scale setups.
- **`Main Camera`:** Represents the user’s head. Its position and rotation are driven by the physical headset, and it is critical for determining teleportation direction and destination.
- **`LeftHand Controller` / `RightHand Controller`:** These contain interaction components like `XR Ray Interactor` or `XR Direct Interactor`, enabling users to point to teleportation targets or interact with objects.

> When using the `XR Interaction Toolkit`, teleportation is usually enabled via an `XR Ray Interactor` (typically on the left or right controller) combined with a `Teleportation Provider`. Upon activation (e.g., by pressing a button), the rig is moved to the selected point on a teleportation surface.


## `Locomotion Mediator`

The `Locomotion Mediator` is a centralized component that coordinates access to the `XR Rig` for various locomotion methods. It ensures that only one locomotion provider—such as teleportation, snap turn, or continuous movement—is actively controlling the `XR Rig` at any given time. By mediating between multiple input-driven locomotion requests, the `Locomotion Mediator` maintains consistency, prevents conflicting movement commands, and helps deliver a smooth and predictable user experience. This coordination is critical in complex VR scenarios where multiple interaction modes may be available simultaneously.

![03](/Figures/D2/03.jpg)

> In earlier versions of Unity, this component was referred to as the **Locomotion System**. Unity 6 replaces it with the **Locomotion Mediator** to better reflect its role in managing movement requests.

## `XR Body Transformer`

The `XR Body Transformer` is a required component when using the `Locomotion Mediator`. It is responsible for applying position and rotation changes to the `XR Rig` in response to locomotion inputs like teleportation or turning. This component acts as the **physical mover**—once the `Locomotion Mediator` grants access to a locomotion provider, the provider delegates movement operations to the `XR Body Transformer`. This separation of concerns helps ensure that movement logic remains modular and extensible.

> The `XR Body Transformer` is typically attached to the same GameObject as the `XR Rig` and must be present for the `Locomotion Mediator` to function correctly.


## Locomotion Providers

These modular components implement specific movement behaviors including teleportation, snap turning, continuous turning, and continuous movement. Each provider extends a common abstract class and is designed to request and relinquish exclusive control over the `XR Rig` via the `Locomotion Mediator`. Their modular design allows developers to mix and match movement types based on application needs. Key locomotion providers in `XR Interaction Toolkit` include `Continuous Turn Provider`, `Continuous Move Provider`, `Snap Turn Provider`, and `Teleportation Provider`.


## `Continuous Turn Provider`

The `Continuous Turn Provider` rotates the `XR Rig` smoothly over time based on user input. While it offers a fluid rotation experience, it must be carefully calibrated since overly rapid or prolonged turning can cause **discomfort** or **motion sickness**. Developers often tie this to the horizontal axis of the right-hand joystick and adjust turn speed to strike a balance between responsiveness and comfort. It is best used in open spaces where users need to orient themselves frequently without relying on teleportation. Follow the instructions below to set it up.

1. **Attach the `Continuous Turn Provider`:**
  - Select your `XR Rig` GameObject.
  - In the `Inspector`, add the `Continuous Turn Provider` component.
  - In the `Mediator` field, assign the existing `Locomotion Mediator` component in the scene. This ensures the turning provider cooperates with other movement systems like teleportation or continuous movement.
  - Ensure the `XR Body Transformer` is also attached to the same GameObject as the `XR Rig`. It is responsible for applying the rotational changes generated by the turn provider.

2. **Configure Turning Parameters:**
  - **`Transformation Priority`:** Set this to `0`. It is an integer value that defines the execution order of movement or rotation operations.
  - **`Turn Speed`:** Set the speed of rotation in degrees per second (e.g., `60` for a smooth turning feel).

    ![04](/Figures/D2/04.jpg)


3. **Set Up Input Actions:**
  - The `Left Hand Turn Input` and `Right Hand Turn Input` fields let you assign float-based input actions for smooth turning from each controller’s joystick.
  - In the `Continuous Turn Provider`, click the **circle (object picker) icon** next to the `Right Hand Turn Input` field.
  - In the search window that appears, type **turn** and select `XR RightHand Locomotion/Turn` from the list.
  - Leave the `Left Hand Turn Input` field empty unless you want to enable turning from the left joystick as well.

    ![05](/Figures/D2/05.jpg)

4. **Run the Scene:**
  - On **Windows**, connect your headset via the **Link** app and enter `Play` mode to test directly in the Editor.
  - On **Mac**, build and deploy the project to your headset using the Android build pipeline, then run it on the device to test.

5. **Observe and Tune:**
  - In the `Scene` view, watch the `XR Rig` rotate around its vertical axis (Y-axis) and verify it's pivoting from the base.
  - Adjust the `Turn Speed` in the `Continuous Turn Provider` for more comfortable or responsive rotation.

6. **Debug Behavior:**
  - Use `Debug.Log()` to track rotation:
    ```csharp
    Debug.Log("XR Rig Y-Rotation: " + transform.eulerAngles.y);
    ```
  - Confirm that smooth turning functions independently of other locomotion methods like movement or teleportation.
  - If rotation feels misaligned, verify the XR Rig’s structure and ensure input actions are assigned correctly.



## `Continuous Move Provider`

The `Continuous Move Provider` gradually translates the `XR Rig` in response to joystick input, allowing users to move smoothly through the virtual world. This form of locomotion mimics real-world walking and enhances immersion, but it must be tuned carefully to avoid causing discomfort. Movement typically follows the headset’s facing direction and supports both forward and strafing (sideways) motion. It’s ideal for exploration-based applications where natural, fluid movement is critical. Follow the steps below to set it up.

1. **Attach the `Continuous Move Provider`:**
  - Select the `XR Rig` GameObject in your scene.
  - In the `Inspector`, add the `Continuous Move Provider` component.
  - In the `Mediator` field, assign the existing `Locomotion Mediator` in the scene. This ensures the movement system cooperates with other locomotion providers like turning or teleportation.
  - Make sure the `XR Body Transformer` is attached to the same GameObject as the `XR Rig`. It applies the translation updates triggered by the move provider.


2. **Configure Movement Parameters:**
  - **`Transformation Priority`:** Set this to `1` to define when this movement is applied relative to other providers (e.g., after turning).
  - **`Move Speed`:** Set the speed of movement in units per second (e.g., `1.5` for walking pace).
- **`Strafe`:** Enable this to allow lateral (sideways) movement from joystick input.
- **`Forward Source`:** Assign the `Main Camera` (within the XR Rig) so that forward input aligns with the user's current gaze direction.

    ![06](/Figures/D2/06.jpg)


3. **Set Up Input Actions:**
  - The `Move` field expects a 2D Vector input, typically from the left-hand joystick.
  - Click the **circle (object picker) icon** next to the `LeftHand Move Input` field.
  - In the search window, type **move** and select `XR LeftHand Locomotion/Move` from the list.
  - Ensure that this action is a 2D Vector bound to the X and Y axes of the left joystick (horizontal = strafe, vertical = forward/backward).

    ![07](/Figures/D2/07.jpg)


5. **Run the Scene:**
  - On **Windows**, connect your headset via the **Link** app and enter `Play` mode to test directly in the Editor.
  - On **Mac**, build and deploy the project to your headset using the Android build pipeline, then run it on the device to test.

6. **Observe and Tune:**
  - In the `Scene` view, move using the left-hand joystick and observe the `XR Rig` translating in space.
  - Confirm that forward movement matches the headset's orientation and that the rig moves at a comfortable speed.
  - Tweak `Move Speed` and `Strafe` settings for responsiveness and comfort.

7. **Debug Movement Behavior:**
  - Use `Debug.Log()` to print the XR Rig’s position during play:
  ```csharp
  Debug.Log("XR Rig Position: " + transform.position);
  ```
  - Confirm that movement is applied in world space and correctly translates joystick input to the expected direction and magnitude.
  - If movement appears off-angle, double-check that the `Forward Source` is correctly referencing the `Main Camera`.



## `Snap Turn Provider`

The `Snap Turn Provider` rotates the `XR Rig` by a fixed angle—such as 45° or 90°—whenever a valid turn input is detected. Because it avoids smooth, continuous rotation, snap turning reduces visual motion and lowers the risk of motion sickness. It is especially useful in confined or object-dense environments, where quick reorientation is needed without displacing the user. Snap turn is commonly paired with teleportation for maximum comfort and usability. Here is how it is set up.

1. **Attach the `Snap Turn Provider`:**
  - Select your `XR Rig` GameObject.
  - In the **Inspector**, add the `Snap Turn Provider (Action-based)` component.
  - Assign the existing `Locomotion Mediator` to the `Mediator` field to ensure that the snap turn provider integrates smoothly with other locomotion systems.
  - Confirm that an `XR Body Transformer` component is attached to the same GameObject as the XR Rig. This component handles the actual rotational transformation requested by the snap turn provider.

    > If your `XR Rig` already includes a `Continuous Turn Provider`, be sure to **disable or remove it**. Only one turn provider should be active at a time to avoid conflicts between smooth and snap turning behaviors.

2. **Configure Snap Turn Parameters:**
  - **`Transformation Priority`:** Set this to `0` unless another provider (like movement) needs to apply first. Lower values apply earlier.
  - **`Turn Amount`:** Choose the angular step for each snap rotation. Typical values are `45` degrees (more granular) or `90` degrees (coarser, faster rotation).
  - **`Debounce Time`:** Set a delay (e.g., `0.5` seconds) between accepted inputs to avoid accidental rapid turning.
  - *`*Enable Turn Left Right`:** Enable it to allow left and right snap turns.
  - **`Enable Turn Around`:** Optionally enable this if you want to support a 180° turn action using a separate input. This is useful in tight or back-facing scenarios.

    ![08](/Figures/D2/08.jpg)

3. **Assign Input Actions:**
  - The provider includes `Left Hand Turn Input` and `Right Hand Turn Input` fields, each expecting a **float-based Input Action** (not a 2D Vector).
  - Click the **circle (object picker) icon** next to the `Right Hand Turn Input` field.
  - In the search window, type **turn** and select `XR RightHand Locomotion/Snap Turn`.
  - Leave the `Left Hand Turn Input` empty unless you wish to support turning via the left-hand joystick.
  - Ensure your input action is a `Value` type bound to the **joystick X-axis** (left = negative, right = positive).

    ![09](/Figures/D2/09.jpg)

4. **Run the Scene:**
  - On **Windows**, connect your headset via the **Link** app and enter `Play` mode to test directly in the Editor.
  - On **Mac**, build and deploy the project to your headset using the Android build pipeline, then test it on the standalone device.

5. **Evaluate Snap Turn Behavior:**
  - Use the joystick to perform snap turns and verify that the XR Rig rotates instantly by the set angle.
  - Observe whether the rotation happens cleanly around the rig's Y-axis and does not affect the camera height or controller offsets.
  - Adjust the `Turn Amount` for the right balance between speed and control based on your scene’s layout (e.g., tighter turns in small spaces).

6. **Refine Timing and Feedback:**
  - If the turn feels too rapid or unintentional, increase the `Debounce Time` to filter out noise or over-triggering.
  - Optionally, add haptic feedback, sound effects, or UI flashes when a turn is performed to improve user awareness.
  - Visual cues—such as a directional arc or quick snap effect—can help users stay oriented after turning in environments with similar or repetitive geometry.


## `Teleportation Provider`

The `Teleportation Provider` allows users to **instantly** relocate the `XR Rig` to a chosen position in the virtual environment. This method avoids the sensory conflict caused by continuous movement, making it highly effective at minimizing motion sickness. It typically works with `Teleportation Area` and `Teleportation Anchor` interactables, and is triggered via a `Ray Interactor` on the controller. Teleportation is ideal for large environments, precision positioning, or setups where natural walking isn’t practical. To setup teleportation, follow the steps below.


1. **Attach the `Teleportation Provider`:**
  - Select your `XR Rig` GameObject in the scene.
  - In the `Inspector`, add the `Teleportation Provider` component.
  - In the `Mediator` field, assign the `Locomotion Mediator` from your scene. This ensures teleportation integrates cleanly with other movement types and manages access to the `XR Rig` without conflict.
  - Verify that the same GameObject also includes an `XR Body Transformer`. This component is responsible for applying the actual transformation—teleporting the user from one location to another.

2. **Configure Teleportation Settings:**
  - **`Transformation Priority`:** Set this to `0` to apply this movement before other providers. 
  - **`Delay Time`:** Optionally delay teleport execution (e.g., for fade-out effects).

    ![10](/Figures/D2/10.jpg)


3. **Assign Controller Input:**
  - Select the controller you want to use for teleportation (e.g., `RightHand Controller`).
  - Ensure the controller has an `XR Ray Interactor` component.
  - Set the `Interaction Layer Mask` to `Everything` to ensure teleport targets are detected during setup and testing.
  - In the `Input Configuration` section of the `XR Ray Interactor`, click the circle icon next to `Activate Input` and select `XR RightHand Locomotion/Teleport Mode Activate` (or the corresponding action for your controller).

    ![11](/Figures/D2/11.jpg)

    - Optionally, assign a **reticle prefab** in the `Reticle` field of the `XR Interactor Line Visual` component to provide visual feedback when a valid teleport surface is targeted.

    ![12](/Figures/D2/12.jpg)

4. **Set Up `Teleportation Area`:**
  - Go to `GameObject > XR > Teleportation Area` to create a surface users can teleport to.
  - Resize and position the area to match your walkable regions (e.g., floors, platforms).
  - In the `Teleportation Area` component, set the `Interaction Manager` field if it is not already populated. Use the same `XR Interaction Manager` used elsewhere in your scene.

    ![13](/Figures/D2/13.jpg)

    > You can assign a custom material (e.g., transparent or semi-transparent) to the `Mesh Renderer` of the `Teleportation Area` to better match your scene’s visual style or to make teleport targets less visually intrusive.

5. **Set Up `Teleportation Anchor` (Optional):**
  - Add a fixed landing spot with a defined orientation via `GameObject > XR > Teleportation Anchor`.
  - Position and rotate the `Teleportation Anchor` to control where and how the user will face after teleporting.
  - In the `Teleportation Anchor` component, assign the `Interaction Manager` field using the same `XR Interaction Manager` used in the rest of your scene (e.g., from the XR Origin or controller objects). Click the **circle icon** to select it from the scene.
  - Set the `Match Orientation` dropdown based on how you want the user to be aligned after teleporting. `None` keeps the user’s current orientation. `Target Up` aligns only the vertical direction (Y-axis). `Target Up And Forward` aligns both vertical and forward directions to match the anchor's transform.

    ![14](/Figures/D2/14.jpg)

    - Optionally, you can replace the anchor with the `Teleport Anchor` prefab (provided by Unity) under `Assets > XFactory > Prefabs > VR > Teleport` to better visualize the position and direction of the teleportation anchor.

    ![16](/Figures/D2/16.jpg)

5. **Run the Scene and Test Teleportation:**
  - On **Windows**, connect your headset using the **Link** app and test teleportation directly in `Play` mode.
  - On **Mac**, build and deploy the app to your headset via Android build pipeline, then run it on the device.
  - Aim the controller at a `Teleportation Area` or `Anchor` using the ray.
  - Press the assigned teleportation input (e.g., joystick forward, trigger hold).
  - Upon release or confirmation, the `XR Rig` should instantly move to the target location.

    ![15](/Figures/D2/15.jpg)

6. **Fine-Tune Interactions:**
  - Adjust teleport behavior for instant versus press-and-hold activation.
  - Address **interaction conflicts**, such as grabbing and UI control—use separate layers and input actions to avoid overlap.
  - Test in a variety of lighting and environment conditions to ensure visual feedback remains visible and intuitive. 
  - Make the teleportation area'a material transparent to make it less visually intrusive.

# Optimize the Project for VR

Before proceeding to other topics in VR development, let's follow a production-oriented workflow to optimize the Unity project for VR. These practices are essential for maintaining high performance (typically **90 FPS**) in VR environments, ensuring a smooth, immersive, and comfortable user experience. Poorly optimized VR apps can lead to nausea, discomfort, and system overheating, especially on standalone devices like Meta Quest 3.

## Measure Your Performance

- **Set a Target Frame Rate:** Most VR headsets require 90 FPS or higher for comfort. Refer to your device’s specifications (e.g., Meta Quest, HTC Vive) and document your target FPS. Setting a clear target allows you to benchmark performance and detect regressions early during development.

- **Monitor Frame Rate Using Stats or Script:** Click the `Stats` button in the top-right corner of the `Game` view to view real-time information such as FPS, draw calls, and triangle count. This is the quickest way to get a basic performance overview while testing in the Editor. You can also display FPS in the scene using a simple script with `1.0f / Time.deltaTime`, shown in a `Text` or `TMP_Text` UI element for live monitoring.  

![17](/Figures/D2/17.jpg)

- **Delve Deeper Into Performance Using Profiler:** For a deeper look into CPU, GPU, memory, rendering, and script performance, open the **Unity Profiler** via `Window > Analysis > Profiler`. It provides real-time charts and timelines, helping you pinpoint bottlenecks while your application is running. These tools are essential for identifying performance issues early — before building for and testing on VR hardware.

![18](/Figures/D2/18.jpg)

- **Test on Device:** Build and run on your actual VR hardware. Use platform tools like **Oculus Developer Hub** or **SteamVR Performance Graph** to verify in-headset FPS. Editor performance is not representative of headset runtime; real-world testing reveals actual user experience and thermal limits.


## Minimize Draw Calls

- **Check Draw Calls in Stats:** Open the `Game View > Stats` window. The “Batches” value shows your draw call count. Target fewer than **175 draw calls** for smooth VR. In the figure above, for example, the number of batches is **over 300**, which is too high for VR, especially if we re targeting standalone headsets like Meta Quest 3 or HTC Vive Focus. High draw call counts increase CPU overhead and reduce frame rates, especially on mobile or standalone headsets.

- **Use Static Batching:** Go to `Edit > Project Settings > Player > Other Settings`. Enable `Static Batching`. This feature lets Unity group static objects, reducing CPU work needed to send rendering instructions.

- **Mark Static Objects:**  In the `Hierarchy`, select non-moving objects. In the `Inspector`, enable the `Static` checkbox to let Unity batch them. Marking objects as static informs the engine that these do not change, allowing more aggressive performance optimizations like lightmapping and occlusion culling.


## Reduce Polygon Count

- **Analyze Triangle Count:** In the `Stats` view, check `Tris` (triangle count). Use `Scene View > Wireframe` mode to inspect object complexity. Lower triangle counts reduce GPU load, making rendering faster and more efficient, particularly for scenes with many objects.

- **Inspect Meshes:** Select objects and check their `Mesh Filter` in the `Inspector`. View the mesh in the `Project` window to see triangle details. Understanding your models' complexity helps you spot and replace unnecessary high-poly meshes early in the pipeline.

- **Simplify High-Poly Assets:** Use modeling tools like **Blender** or optimization tools like **Simplygon** to reduce polycounts. Use `LOD Group` components (`GameObject > LOD Group`) for objects that can have lower detail at distance. This helps maintain high visual quality up close while reducing rendering costs when objects are farther from the camera.

## Optimize Textures

- **Adjust Import Settings:** Select textures in the `Project` view. In the `Inspector`, adjust `Max Size`, `Format`, and `Compression`. Smaller and compressed textures load faster, use less memory, and reduce the bandwidth needed for GPU rendering.

- **Enable Mip Maps:** In the texture import settings, check `Generate Mip Maps` to reduce overdraw at distance. Mip maps improve performance and visual quality by lowering texture resolution for far-away objects, reducing aliasing.

- **Use Anisotropic Filtering:** Set `Aniso Level` to `2–8` for floor or angled surfaces to improve sharpness at oblique views. This reduces blurring of textures viewed from shallow angles, such as factory floors or walls, enhancing realism.

## Optimize Particles and Effects

- **Simplify Particle Systems:** Use `Universal Render Pipeline/Particles/Unlit` shaders for particles. Minimize particle count and lifetime. Complex particle systems are expensive and can tank performance quickly in VR; using unlit shaders avoids lighting overhead.

- **Limit Post-Processing Effects:** Add a `Volume` to the Main Camera. Create and assign a `Volume Profile`. Use only lightweight effects like `Color Adjustments` or `Bloom`, and avoid `Motion Blur`, `Chromatic Aberration`, and `Lens Distortion`. Post-processing can dramatically impact performance and user comfort. Some effects are disorienting or nauseating in VR.


## Apply Efficient Anti-Aliasing

- **Set MSAA in URP Asset:** Locate your `UniversalRenderPipelineAsset` (e.g., `URP-HighQuality`). In the `Inspector` under `Quality`, set `MSAA` to `4x`. Multi-sample anti-aliasing smooths jagged edges with minimal performance hit, especially important for headset displays.

- **Enable FXAA on Camera:** On the `Main Camera`, enable `Post Processing`. In `Anti-Aliasing`, choose `FXAA` or `SMAA` as lightweight options. These screen-space algorithms are efficient and help polish visual quality without sacrificing performance.

- **Adjust High-Detail Materials:** For detailed objects like machines or robots, use baked `Reflection Probes` and simpler shaders. Real-time reflections and complex PBR shaders are GPU-intensive and should be avoided or simulated in VR contexts.

## Additional Tips

- **Occlusion Culling:** Open `Window > Rendering > Occlusion Culling`. Bake occlusion data to prevent rendering of objects blocked from view. This improves performance by skipping rendering for hidden geometry, especially useful in indoor scenes like XFactory.

- **Lightmapping:** Use `Baked Lighting` for static geometry and `Mixed Lighting` with `Shadowmask` for semi-dynamic objects. Baked lighting provides high visual fidelity at a fraction of the real-time lighting cost. To generate a lightmap, open the `Lighting` window (`Window > Rendering > Lighting > Environment`), scroll to the `Lightmapping Settings` section, and click `Generate Lighting`. Make sure your static objects are marked as `Lightmap Static`, and verify that `Baked Global Illumination` is enabled under `Mixed Lighting` for successful baking.

- **Profiler Monitoring:** In `Window > Analysis > Profiler`, use the `Rendering` tab to find bottlenecks such as `Camera.Render`, `Shadows.Render`, or `PostProcessing.Render`. Regular use of the Profiler helps catch performance issues early and guides your optimization decisions with real data.
