# What Is a Game Engine?

Game engines, also referred to as **rendering engines**, function as real‑time **operating systems for spatial computing**, turning static 3D models and data into living, interactive XR environments. Under the hood they blend advanced **graphics pipelines**, **physics solvers**, **audio engines**, **networking layers**, and **XR device APIs** into a single, extensible platform. Because everything updates at frame‑rate, you can iterate at the speed of thought: test a product design prototype in VR, inspect tolerances at 1:1 scale, or invite remote teammates into a shared AR model for real‑time feedback—all without re‑exporting files or waiting for offline renders. The result is faster design cycles, earlier error detection, and richer communication with stakeholders who may lack traditional engineering backgrounds. The most commonly adopted modern game engines are [Unity](https://unity.com) and [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US). Key features of these engines include:

- **Real‑Time Rendering:** The engine draws a fresh image 30-90 times every second, so anything you move, click, or look at updates instantly. It handles the heavy math of turning 3D triangles into pixels, calculating lighting and shadows, and running tiny GPU programs called **shaders**—like a high‑speed photo studio that relights your model on the fly.

- **Physics Simulation:** Built‑in physics makes virtual objects fall, collide, and roll just as they would in real life. Add a `Rigidbody` component and the engine automatically applies gravity, detects collisions, and lets you tweak properties such as mass or friction. You can drop a gear into a gearbox, test clearances, or preview crash scenarios without writing physics equations.

- **Scene Graph and Object Management:** Every item in the world is a **GameObject** with a `Transform` (`Position`, `Rotation`, `Scale`). Objects can be parents or children—much like parts in an assembly tree—so moving a parent moves all its children. This lets you group bolts on a flange, animate a robot arm, or hide/show an entire subsystem with one click.

- **Scripting and Interactivity:** To make things happen, you write concise scripts—specifically in `C#` for Unity—that run each frame or respond to events (e.g., “when the user presses the Start button, play an animation”). Think of a script as a **recipe**: “grab this part, rotate it 90°, then display a prompt.”

- **Asset Management and Import Pipelines:** An **asset** is any 3D model, texture, sound, or video. Unity’s importer converts formats like `FBX`, `OBJ`, `STL`, and even raw `CAD` (with plugins such as [Pixyz](https://www.pixyz-software.com) or [Unity Reflect](https://learn.unity.com/project/introduction-to-unity-reflect)) into optimized engine files. Once imported, you just drag‑and‑drop assets into your scene, and the engine tracks every change automatically.

- **XR Integration and Input Handling:** Unity’s [XR Interaction Toolkit](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.interaction.toolkit@3.2/manual/index.html) and [OpenXR](https://www.khronos.org/openxr/) support abstract away differences between headsets. You can map actions (e.g., grab, teleport, pinch) without worrying whether the user has a [Meta Quest](https://www.meta.com/quest/quest-3/?srsltid=AfmBOoqcl_uFAZFd15zNdKgZnSS60olI3A41h4Puean1N1f6tHdoG1f9), [HTC Vive](https://www.vive.com/us/), or [Microsoft HoloLens](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens/). Hand tracking, eye tracking, and haptics can be enabled with a checkbox or a few lines of script.

- **Cross‑Platform Deployment:** After your scene works, you can build it for **Windows**, **macOS**, **Linux**, **iOS**, **Android**, **WebGL**, **VisionOS** and nearly every XR headset—all from the same project. Unity gathers the right libraries, compresses textures, and creates an installer or APK, so you don’t have to maintain separate code bases for each platform.

# Basics of Unity

At the core of this course lies the **Unity Editor**—a powerful platform for building immersive applications, games, and simulations. Let's create our first Unity project and import a custom industrial environment called the **XFactory**, which will serve as a hands-on environment throughout the course.

## Creating a Unity Project

Let’s start by setting up the foundation for our XR project:

1. Open **Unity Hub**.
2. Navigate to the **Projects** tab and click **New Project**.
3. Select the **Universal 3D** template. (We will use standard 3D unless stated otherwise.)
4. Choose the Unity **Editor version** (e.g., 6000.0.45f1 LTS or similar). Install it via Unity Hub if not available.
5. Assign **Project name** something like `XFactory`.
6. Choose a **Location** on your system to save the project.
7. Click **Create project** to open the Unity Editor.

    ![06](/Figures/B1/06.jpg)

> Once your project loads, we are ready to bring in our XFactory environment.

## Importing Custom Packages

To simulate real-world engineering scenarios, we will use a custom Unity package that contains a virtual factory environment—complete with 3D models, prefabs, textures, materials, lighting, and more. This factory consists of five major stations: **Logistics**, **Manufacturing**, **Assembly**, **Welding**, and **Exhibit**. You will explore these areas and use them in practical exercises. To import the package:

1. Download `XFactory.unitypackage` from the course GitHub.
2. In the Unity Editor, go to `Assets > Import Package > Custom Package...`.

    ![07](/Figures/B1/07.jpg)

3. Select the `XFactory.unitypackage` file.
4. In the import window, click `All` to ensure all assets are selected, then click `Import`.

    ![08](/Figures/B1/08.jpg)

> After importing, you will find scenes under `Assets/XFactory/Scenes/`. We recommend starting with the `Factory Floor Scene`.

## Unity Editor Interface

The [**Unity Editor interface**](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.1/Documentation/Manual/unity-editor.html) is your primary workspace for game and application development using Unity. It consists of several customizable **panels** or **windows**, each responsible for a different aspect of your project workflow:

- **[Scene View](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.1/Documentation/Manual/UsingTheSceneView.html):** Your interactive 3D (or 2D) workspace where you place, move, and organize objects in the environment.
- **[Game View](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.1/Documentation/Manual/GameView.html):** A real-time, in-editor preview of how your project will appear and behave when run.
- **[Hierarchy Window](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.1/Documentation/Manual/Hierarchy.html):** Displays a tree view of all GameObjects in the current scene, showing their parent-child relationships.
- **[Project Window](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.1/Documentation/Manual/ProjectView.html):** Acts as your asset library, organizing all files in your project folder such as models, scripts, audio, and prefabs.
- **[Inspector Window](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.1/Documentation/Manual/UsingTheInspector.html):** Shows detailed properties of the selected object, allowing you to view and edit components and values.
- **[Toolbar](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.1/Documentation/Manual/Toolbar.html):** Provides essential controls such as Play, Pause, and Step, along with tools for moving, rotating, and scaling objects.

> To customize the **Default Layout**, follow [this Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CustomizingYourWorkspace.html#:~:text=You%20can%20customize%20your%20Layout,View%20in%20a%20new%20window.).


## Scene View

The `Scene` view is your canvas—a 3D environment where you can place, view, and edit GameObjects. After opening the `Factory Floor Scene`, use the mouse and keyboard to **navigate through the factory**. Visit each engineering station and examine the assets. Use the `Move`, `Rotate`, and `Scale` tools to interact with equipment.

**Navigation Tips:**
  - **Look around:** Hold the right mouse button and drag to look around the scene.
  - **Move:** Use the `WASD` keys or the arrow keys to move around the environment.
  - **Zoom:** Use the mouse scroll wheel to zoom in and out.
  - **Focus Object:** Select an object and press `F` to center the camera on it.

**Scene Tools:**
- **View Tool:** Use this tool to pan the camera around the scene.
- **Move Tool:** Use this tool to move objects along the X, Y, and Z axes.
- **Rotate Tool:** Use this tool to spin or rotate objects in the scene.
- **Scale Tool:** Use this tool to resize objects as needed.
- **Rect Tool:** Use this tool for 2D or UI elements to move, resize, and align objects within a rectangular bounding box.
- **Transform Tool:** Use this combined tool to move, rotate, and scale objects with a single unified handle.

![09](/Figures/B1/09.jpg)

> Review this [Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.1/Documentation/Manual/UsingTheSceneView.html) to learn more about the Scene view. Note that Unity does **not auto-save** you scene, so remember to save frequently! Press `Ctrl+S` (`Cmd+S` on Mac) or go to `File > Save Scene`. If you see an asterisk (`*`) next to your scene’s name, there are **unsaved changes**.

## Game View

The `Game` window shows the player's perspective; i.e., what the XR user will experience.
- Click `Play` in the toolbar to enter play mode.
- Navigate the factory as a player would in an XR simulation.
- Observe camera perspectives, lighting, and interactivity.

![10](/Figures/B1/10.jpg)

> Review this [Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.1/Documentation/Manual/GameView.html) to learn more about the Game view. Note that any changes made in play mode are **temporary**. Always exit Play Mode before editing assets or scenes.


## Hierarchy Window

The `Hierarchy` window lists every GameObject in your current scene and helps you organize your scene. In the `Factory Floor Scene`, you will see objects organized by zones, including `Factory Floor`, `Logistics`, `Manufacturing`, `Assembly`, `Welding`, and `Exhibit`.

![11](/Figures/B1/11.jpg)

> Review this [Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.1/Documentation/Manual/Hierarchy.html) to learn more about the Hierarchy window. Use the triangle next to each to expand and view child objects (e.g., `Logistics > Drone > Eye`).

## Project Window

The `Project` window is the central library for all assets used in your Unity project. It mirrors the structure of your project's file system and allows you to organize, browse, and manage everything your game or application needs. These reusable assets are critical for building and scaling your project efficiently:

- **Animations:** Define how objects move or behave over time, bringing characters and UI elements to life.
- **Audio:** Sound files including music, sound effects, and voiceovers used to enhance the game’s atmosphere and feedback.  
- **Fonts:** Typographic assets used to render text in UI elements, dialogue, menus, and other text-based components.  
- **Materials:** Control how surfaces appear by defining properties like color, texture, and reflectivity.
- **Models:** 3D or 2D objects imported from external tools (e.g., Blender or Maya) that form the physical components of your scene.
- **Prefabs:** Saved, reusable GameObjects with predefined configurations—ideal for repeating structures like enemies, items, or UI panels.
- **Scenes:** Self-contained environments or levels in your game, each with its own arrangement of objects and settings.
- **Scripts:** Code files (typically in C#) that define custom behavior, logic, and interactivity in your game.
- **Shaders:** Small programs that define how surfaces are rendered visually, enabling effects like lighting, shadows, transparency, and glow.
- **Textures:** Image files applied to models and UI to give them visual detail, such as wood grain, metal, or skin.

![12](/Figures/B1/12.jpg)

> Review this [Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.1/Documentation/Manual/ProjectView.html) to learn more about the Project window.

## Inspector Window

The `Inspector` window displays a detailed breakdown of the selected GameObject’s **components**—the modular building blocks that define its behavior and appearance. Using the `Inspector`, you can attach built-in components like `Collider` (for collision detection) or `Rigidbody` (for physics simulation), add your own `C#` scripts to implement custom logic, or modify values directly in the UI to prototype or fine-tune gameplay behavior. When you select an object (e.g., the **drone** in a logistics station), the `Inspector` shows all attached components and allows you to edit their properties in real time. Common components include:

- **`Transform`:** Defines the object’s `Position`, `Rotation`, and `Scale` in the scene—present on all GameObjects by default.
- **`Mesh Renderer`:** Controls how the object is visually rendered, including its shape and whether it is visible.
- **`Material`:** Applies a visual style or texture to the object’s surface, affecting how it looks under lighting.
- **`Script` (if any):** Custom `C#` scripts that define behavior such as movement, interaction, or animations.

![13](/Figures/B1/13.jpg)

> Review this [Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.1/Documentation/Manual/UsingTheInspector.html) to learn more about the Inspector window.

# GameObjects

In Unity, [**GameObjects**](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.1/Documentation/Manual/GameObjects.html) are the fundamental building blocks of a scene. They act as containers for [**Components**](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.1/Documentation/Manual/Components.html), which define their appearance, behavior, and functionality. Every object in Unity—whether it is a cube, a robot, a light source, or an interactive button—is a GameObject. GameObjects are the core of Unity projects, with different types serving specific roles. Let's review **different types of GameObjects** available in Unity and explore their function and significance: `Empty`, `Camera`, `2D Object`, `3D Object`, `Effects`, `Light`, `Audio`, `Video`, `UI`, and other GameObjects.

![14](/Figures/B1/14.jpg)

> To create a GameObject, right-click in the `Hierarchy` window or click `GameObject` from the Unity bar menu and select the desired GameObject type.

## Empty GameObject
An **Empty GameObject** is a basic, featureless object that serves as a **container** for other GameObjects or components. It can be used for:
- **Organizing the scene** by acting as a parent object for multiple child objects.
- **Acting as a reference point** for positioning and transformations.
- **Holding scripts** to define custom behaviors.

> In the XFactory, you might use `Empty` GameObjects to group all drones and racks under a "LogisticsStation" parent or to serve as a pivot for robotic arm animations in the Welding Station.

## Camera
`Camera` in Unity capture and render the game world from a specific perspective.

- **Main Camera:** The default camera in Unity scenes, responsible for rendering the player’s view.  
- **Cinematic Camera (Cinemachine):** A more advanced camera used for smooth transitions, cutscenes, and automatic tracking of objects.

> In XFactory, Cinemachine can be used to follow a mobile robot in the assembly area or provide guided tours through the exhibit station.

## 3D Object
Unity provides built-in **3D primitives** and tools for modeling environments. Important 3D GameObjects:

- **`Cube`:** A simple six-sided box.  
- **`Sphere`:** A perfectly round 3D object.  
- **`Capsule`:** A rounded cylinder, often used for character colliders.  
- **`Cylinder`:** A circular column.  
- **`Plane`:** A flat surface often used as a ground or floor.  
- **`Quad`:** A two-triangle surface, useful for textures and billboards.  
- **`Text - TextMeshPro`:** A high-quality text rendering system for 3D space.

> Many base structures in the XFactory scene—such as floors, crates, and placeholder equipment—use Unity’s primitive 3D objects. TextMeshPro is used for floating labels above machines like CNC units and the 3D printer.

## Effects
Effects in Unity add **visual enhancements** such as fire, smoke, trails, or outlines.

- **`Particle System`:** Generates visual effects like fire, smoke, or explosions.  
- **`Trail Renderer`:** Creates a fading trail behind a moving object.  
- **`Line Renderer`:** Draws a straight or curved line in 3D space.  

> In XFactory, particle systems can simulate welding sparks, while trail and line renderers can be used to show drone flight paths or laser alignment guides.

## Light
Lighting in Unity enhances **realism** and **atmosphere**.

- **`Directional Light`:** Simulates sunlight, affecting all objects uniformly.  
- **`Point Light`:** Emits light in all directions from a single point (like a light bulb).  
- **`Spot Light`:** Projects light in a cone shape.  
- **`Area Light`:** Used for realistic soft lighting (requires baked lighting).  
- **`Reflection Probe`:** Captures and reflects the surrounding environment for realistic reflections.  

> The XFactory interior is lit using a mix of point and area lights for realism. Directional light is used in the outdoor scene, while reflection probes help simulate polished surfaces on robotic arms and factory equipment.

## Audio
Unity’s audio system allows for **spatialized 3D sound** and **ambient effects**.

- **`Audio Source`:** Plays sounds like background music, dialogue, or sound effects.  
- **`Reverb Zone`:** Alters how sound behaves in different areas (e.g., echo in a cave).  

> Use audio sources in XFactory to simulate machine noise in the manufacturing station or forklift alerts in Logistics. Reverb zones can enhance immersion in the enclosed Welding Station.

## Video
Unity supports **video playback** in games and XR applications. **`Video Player`** plays video files in Unity, either on a 3D object or full-screen.

> The large interactive displays in the Tech Station use video players to showcase training materials or machine diagnostics.

## UI (User Interface)
Unity’s **UI system** is used to create **menus**, **HUDs**, and **interactive elements**.

- **`Canvas`:** The root UI container that holds all UI elements.  
- **`Text`** / **`TextMeshPro`:** Displays readable text in the UI.  
- **`Image`:** Displays a visual image in the UI.  
- **`Button`:** An interactive button that triggers actions.  
- **`Toggle`:** A checkbox-like UI element for on/off states.  
- **`Slider`:** Allows selection of a value within a range.  
- **`Scrollbar`:** Enables scrolling content.  
- **`Dropdown`:** Displays a list of selectable options.  
- **`Input Field`:** Allows users to type text input.  
- **`Event System`:** Handles UI interactions and input events.  

> In XFactory, you will find UI elements used on virtual control panels—e.g., toggling between robot programs, adjusting conveyor speed with sliders, or selecting part types from dropdowns in the assembly station.

## Other GameObjects
Unity includes additional objects for **AI**, **rendering**, and **physics interactions**.

- **`NavMesh` & `NavMesh Agent`:** Used for AI pathfinding.  
- **`Volume`:** Controls post-processing effects like bloom, depth of field, and color grading.  
- **`Rendering Components`:** Used for advanced graphics optimizations.  

> XFactory uses NavMesh Agents for robot navigation, such as the quadruped in the Tech Station. Volumes help define immersive lighting and AR-like visual effects in high-tech zones.

# Prefabs
A [**Prefab**](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.1/Documentation/Manual/prefabs-introduction.html) in Unity is a **pre-configured GameObject** that can be reused multiple times in a scene or across multiple scenes. Prefabs store all components, child objects, and settings of a GameObject as an `Asset`, making it easier to manage and instantiate objects at runtime. Instead of manually copying and pasting GameObjects, prefabs allow you to:
- **Maintain consistency** across different scenes.
- **Easily update all instances** of a prefab from a single source.
- **Optimize performance** by using pre-configured assets.
- **Spawn GameObjects dynamically** at runtime (e.g., bullets, NPCs, power-ups).  

> In the XFactory project, many complex elements—like drones, forklifts, CNC machines, and UI panels—are stored as prefabs in the `Assets > Prefabs` folder for easy reuse across the factory’s interior and exterior scenes.

## Creating Prefabs

1. **Create or Select a GameObject:**
  - In the `Hierarchy` window, create or select a GameObject that you want to turn into a prefab.  
  - Configure it with the desired **Components**, **Textures**, and **Settings**.  

    > For instance, configure a 3D printer model with all necessary materials, animations, and scripts before saving it as a prefab.

2. **Convert the GameObject into a Prefab:**
  - Open the `Project` window.  
  - Navigate to the `Assets > Prefabs` folder (or create a new folder for organization).  
  - **Drag and drop** the selected GameObject from the `Hierarchy` window into the `Project` window.  
  - The object now appears as a **blue-colored prefab**, indicating that it is linked to the original prefab asset.  
  - You can also create a prefab by clicking `GameObject > Convert to Prefab` from the top menu.

    ![15](/Figures/B1/15.jpg)

> Review this [Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.1/Documentation/Manual/CreatingPrefabs.html) to learn more about how to create a prefab. 

## Editing Prefabs
There are two ways to edit a prefab:  

1. **Editing the Prefab Asset (Affects All Instances):**
  - Double-click the prefab in the `Project` window to enter `Prefab Mode`.  
  - Modify the object (e.g., change components, adjust materials, add new child objects).  
  - All **instances of the prefab** in the scene will update automatically.  

    ![16](/Figures/B1/16.jpg)

2. **Editing a Single Prefab Instance (Overrides):** Sometimes, you may want **some prefab instances to be slightly different** from the original prefab. You can **override** settings on an individual instance.  
  - **Select the prefab instance** in the `Hierarchy` window.  
  - Modify the `Transform`, `Material`, or other components in the `Inspector`.  
  - The changes will apply **only to that instance** (not to other instances).  
  - If you want to **apply the changes to all prefab instances**, click `Apply` in the `Inspector` window.  
  - If you want to **reset changes**, click `Revert` to restore the instance to the original prefab.  

> Review this [Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.1/Documentation/Manual/EditingInPrefabMode.html) to learn more about how to edit prefabs.

## Nested Prefabs
Unity allows prefabs to contain **other prefabs** as **child objects**. This is called [**nested prefabs**](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.1/Documentation/Manual/NestedPrefabs.html), and it makes it easier to build **complex objects** while keeping parts reusable. 

![18](/Figures/B1/18.jpg)

> In XFactory, a CNC machine prefab might include nested prefabs for the machine base, control panel, or add-on accessories. This structure allows each component to be reused and managed independently.


## Prefab Variants  
A [**prefab variant**](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.1/Documentation/Manual/PrefabVariants.html) is a modified version of a base prefab that still maintains a connection to it. This allows for variations of a prefab without completely losing its link to the original. To create a prefab variant:
1. **Duplicate** an existing prefab in the `Project` window (`Right-click > Duplicate`).
2. Modify the new prefab while keeping its connection to the original.  
3. Changes made to the **base prefab** will still affect the variant unless overridden.  

> In XFactory, use prefab variants to create different models of AMR mobile robots that share a base behavior but have unique attachments or sensors.

In Unity, [**Components**](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.1/Documentation/Manual/unity-components.html) are the building blocks that define the behaviors and functionalities of a **GameObject**. Every **GameObject** starts as an **empty container**, meaning it has no inherent properties beyond its existence in the scene. However, by attaching Components, you can add specific features such as **rendering**, **physics**, **audio**, **UI elements**, and custom logic through **scripting**. Components play key roles in Unity:

- They act as modular pieces that you attach to a GameObject to define how it behaves in the virtual world.  
- Unity follows a **composition-based** system, meaning a GameObject is defined by the Components attached to it rather than by inheritance from a predefined class.  
- A single GameObject can have multiple Components, each contributing a different aspect of its behavior.

> In XFactory, components bring machines, robots, drones, screens, and other objects to life. For instance, adding an `Animator` to a robot arm controls its movements, while an `Audio Source` makes the welding equipment emit realistic sound effects or a custom script simulates machining processes.

## Types of Components

Here are the different types of GameObjects and the components commonly associated with them:

- **Basic GameObject:** Typically includes a `Transform` component and may include custom scripts for behavior.
- **Camera:** Uses the `Camera` component and may also include a `Cinemachine Virtual Camera` for advanced control.
- **2D Objects:** Often include components like `Sprite Renderer`, `Rigidbody 2D`, and `Collider 2D` for physics and interaction.
- **3D Objects:** Common components include `Mesh Renderer`, `Mesh Filter`, `Rigidbody`, and various types of `Colliders`.
- **Effects:** These objects use components such as `Particle System`, `Trail Renderer`, and `Line Renderer` to create visual effects.
- **Lights:** Use components like `Light`, `Reflection Probe`, and `Light Probe Group` to illuminate and reflect within scenes.
- **Audio:** Include components such as `Audio Source`, `Audio Listener`, and `Audio Reverb Zone` to handle sound playback and spatial audio.
- **Video:** Use the `Video Player` component to play video content within the scene.
- **UI Elements:** Utilize components such as `Canvas`, `Rect Transform`, `Image`, `Button`, `TextMeshPro`, `Slider`, and `Toggle` to build user interfaces.
- **Animated Objects:** Include `Animator` and `Animation` components to enable motion and behavior over time.
- **AI & Navigation:** Use `NavMeshAgent` and `NavMeshObstacle` for AI-controlled navigation and pathfinding.
- **Post-Processing Effects:** Rely on components like `Post-Processing Volume` and `Post-Processing Layer` to apply visual enhancements.
- **XR (VR/AR):** Include `XR Rig` and `XR Controller` components to support extended reality experiences.
- **Networking (Multiplayer):** Utilize components like `Network Manager` and `Network Identity` to enable multiplayer functionality.

> To add a component to a GameObject via the `Inspector`, select the GameObject in the `Hierarchy`, then click the `Add Component` button at the bottom of the `Inspector` and choose the desired component from the list.

## Inspecting a Component

The `Inspector` window is where you **view, edit, and adjust** all **Components** attached to a selected **GameObject**. It serves as the primary interface for modifying object properties, applying scripts, and fine-tuning behaviors without directly altering code. To navigate the `Inspector`:
1. Select a GameObject in the `Hierarchy` window.
2. The `Inspector` window will display all the **Components** attached to that GameObject.
3. Each Component has its own **adjustable parameters** (e.g., numbers, checkboxes, dropdowns, sliders). You can:
   - **Modify values** (e.g., changing a Transform’s `Position`, `Rotation`, or `Scale`).
   - **Toggle Components on/off** (using the checkbox next to a component’s name).
   - **Add new Components** by clicking the `Add Component` button.
   - **Remove Components** by clicking the `⋮` menu (three dots) and selecting `Remove Component`.
   - **Drag and drop assets** (e.g., materials, audio clips, prefabs) into appropriate fields.
   - **Edit script-exposed variables** for custom components (e.g., adjusting player speed in a `PlayerController` script).
